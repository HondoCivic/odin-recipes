    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Same smash burger size, but twice the amount of crisp, browned crust.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 soft hamburger roll, buttered and toasted</li>
        <li>Condiments and toppings as desired, such as mayonnaise, mustard, shredded lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles</li>
        <li>4 ounces (110g) freshly ground beef chuck, divided into two 2-ounce (55g) balls</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 slice good melting cheese, such as American, cheddar, or homemade melting cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and 
            smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly 
            wider than burger bun.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn 
            pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully 
            scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits.
        </li>
        <li>
            Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately 
            remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
